<h1> Welcome to Southern New Hampshire DSA </h1>
<h2>Thank you for visiting the Southern New Hampshire chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). We are a passionate community dedicated to building an inclusive, democratically-run society prioritizing human needs over corporate profits. </h2>
<h3>What is Democratic Socialism?</h3>
<p>Democratic Socialism is a political and economic philosophy that merges the ideals of democracy with socialism. Unlike traditional socialism, which often emphasizes state ownership of the primary means of production, Democratic Socialism focuses on achieving socialist goals within a democratic framework. This means that while the economy and society should be run democratically to ensure everyone benefits, it doesn't necessarily advocate for the outright elimination of the market or private ownership. Instead, it seeks a balance between the two, ensuring that wealth and power are distributed more equitably among the populace and essential services like healthcare, education, and housing are accessible to all.</p>
<h3>Our Growth and Journey</h3>
<p>Over recent years, the DSA has seen a meteoric rise in membership. Nationally, our community has expanded fourfold, boasting over 85,000 members across all 50 states. In Southern New Hampshire, our journey has been particularly inspiring. What began as a modest group rapidly evolved into a thriving community of hundreds. This remarkable growth, achieved since our founding in 2019, is a testament to our all-volunteer team’s dedication and hard work.</p>
<h3>Why The Surge In Membership?</h3>
<p>The post-2016 election landscape shed light on multiple deep-seated issues in American society, many of which can be traced back to the unchecked spread of neoliberal policies. Neoliberalism, with its emphasis on deregulation, free-market capitalism, and a shrinking role for the state in welfare, has, over time, led to growing income inequality, job insecurity, and a widening wealth gap. These policies often privilege corporate interests at the expense of the common good, with resources and wealth becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the influence of the billionaire class on politics has become increasingly evident. Many politicians appear more beholden to their wealthy donors than their constituents. This undue influence has further eroded trust in democratic institutions, as policies often reflect the interests of the elite rather than the broader populace.</p>
<p>Many individuals have become disillusioned with a system that, while purporting to be democratic, predominantly serves the interests of a privileged few. The younger generation, in particular, is witnessing the deteriorating state of the planet alongside a capitalist system that often perpetuates debt, mental health challenges, and economic inequality. These combined challenges—failures of neoliberalism and the evident sway of billionaire-backed politicians—have galvanized many to seek alternatives, leading to the surge in DSA membership.</p>

<h3>Mission and Vision of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)</h3>
<p>The DSA is the largest socialist organization in the United States. Our members are at the forefront, pioneering progressive initiatives for meaningful social transformation and anchoring an unequivocally democratic socialist identity within the fabric of American communities and their political landscape.</p>
<p>Central to our ideological framework is an unwavering allegiance to democracy. We see it as both a method for change and an ultimate goal. Recognizing that the dismantling of capitalism is a long-term objective, the DSA actively champions contemporary reforms that curtail corporate dominance and amplify the voices of the working class. Among the reforms we endorse are: </p>
<ul>
<li> Decrease the influence of money in politics</li>
<li> Empower ordinary people in workplaces and the economy </li>
<li> And restructure gender and cultural relationships to be more equitable.</li>

</ul>
<p> Our commitment is not just to democracy as a principle but as an actionable tool to reshape society. We envision a world where individuals have authentic agency in decisions and relationships that mold their lives. This aspirational future, which we term "democratic socialism," is characterized by increased freedom, democratic integrity, and a compassionate human society.</p>
<p>Our socialist identity stems from our rejection of a global economy anchored in private gains, disengaged labor, systemic discrimination based on race and gender, environmental degradation, and the perpetuation of violence to maintain existing hierarchies.</p>
<p>We identify as socialists because we are driven by a collective dream: a global community rooted in democratic planning complemented by market strategies. This dream emphasizes equitable resource distribution, fulfilling employment, ecological sustainability, gender, and racial parity, and relationships free from oppression.</p>
