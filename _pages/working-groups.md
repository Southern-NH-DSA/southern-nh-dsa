<h3>Communications Committee</h3>

The Communications Committee is responsible for overseeing the chapter's social media platforms and all communication efforts within the organization. This includes drafting and distributing a comprehensive monthly bulletin that provides an overview of the chapter's activities, initiatives, and key developments. In addition, the committee actively seeks opportunities to collaborate with other leftist organizations and groups, with the goal of fostering strategic partnerships and strengthening our coalition to advance shared objectives and expand our collective impact.
